Quick-Show

Quick-Show is a movie ticket booking website built to understand how modern frontend applications handle bookings and user roles. The project focuses on creating a smooth and reliable booking experience while keeping the interface clean and responsive.

Instead of just displaying movie data, Quick-Show allows users to actively select seats and complete bookings, while admins manage shows and availability behind the scenes.

Why This Project

I built Quick-Show to practice working with real-time UI updates, user flows, and role-based access. It helped me understand how a typical booking system works from both a user’s and an admin’s point of view.

Technologies Used

What I Learned

Building Quick-Show improved my understanding of React components, state handling, and frontend architecture. It also helped me learn how to design practical user flows and maintain a consistent experience across different screen sizes.
